Parallel algorithm for improve speed-up spatial query in large SQLite SpatiaLite databases.
This is a early adopted version of code. 

Program tested in Python 2.7 with installed special extension:
1. Cyqlite (https://sourceforge.net/projects/cyqlite/) special files overwriting standard sqlite extension for enable spatial index. 
   For example: sqlite-dll-win32-x86 
2. Mod_spatialite ( from http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/)

File db_small.zip is sample dataset. Please unpack this file in any destination to test the algorithm.
